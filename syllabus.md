Piazza Discussion etiquette:
1. Ask HW questions only in HW posts.\
We’ve created individual posts for each problem from homework. Please ask questions, discuss problems, or help out in those
posts only. Before asking a question, read through (or search) the whole post to see if your question has been answered. The same applies for Problem Sets and Exams.
2. Don’t post answers on Piazza.\
Please don’t give away the answer on Piazza. You can explain things in a way that still lets other students figure out the
essence of the problem on their own, but don’t spoil the problem.
3. Try to make posts public.\
While not violating Rule 2, try to make your questions public, because others might have the same question and we don’t
need to answer them multiple times.
4. Piazza is not OH. 5 minute-test.\
If you think your questions may take more than 5 minutes to answer, please come to oﬃce hours.
5. Piazza is not for pre-grading.\
Please do not use Piazza as a medium to ask instructors to check your homework in advance. We simply cannot check every
student’s homework through Piazza.
6. Post a screen shot of any resource referenced.\
Your question should be self-contained. The responders should not have to scan through PDFs to even figure out what the
question is. Ask yourself: am I referring to some lecture note/HW solution/discussion solution/past exam?
If the answer is yes, post a screen shot of the relevant part.
