## Project Ideas

Model an interesting motion. For inspiration:
- [rotations.berkeley.edu](rotations.berkeley.edu)
- Andy Ruina
- My papers
- See Professor Shane Ross lectures

## Assigned Projects
- Building a hula hooping robot + conducting experiments (Wafic Itani).
- Simulating a legged robot walking on sand (Nour Hallak and Karim Braidi).
- Learning and Predicting the Dynamics of a Hopping Wheel with Imbalance (Jawad Chamoun, Jad Dagher, and Elias Sebaaly)

## Unassigned Projects
- Modeling a stack of blocks on an oscillating foundation using the discrete element methods (TBD).
- Simulating a 3D block on a moving foundation and exploring possible motions (TBD).
- Simulating a hopping hula hoop, ie. the jump of a wheel with a mass imbalance (TBD).
- Obtaining the phase space of the previously mentioned hopping hula hoop with a mass imbalance (TBD).
- Explore the algorithms that 'optimize' that data from two sensors on the same rigid body (TBD).

## Homework Ideas

### Recreate iPhone toss animation

### Two sensors on hula hoop
- Quantify noise by veryfing all measures of rigidity you can think of
- Plot the motion of the hula hoop: introduce students to averaging algorithms
